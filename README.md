This responsive portfolio was built with a mobile-first mindset utilizing media queries to set breakpoints at which the layout would change. It was one of the first mobile-first and responsive projects I have worked on. It was completed as part of the Scrimba Front-End Development Career Path - Module 5, taught by Kevin Powell, and modified by me.
